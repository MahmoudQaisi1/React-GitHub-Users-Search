Build React web page with one input and search button

The input takes a username and the search button send a request to https://api.github.com/users/{username} 

for example: https://api.github.com/users/mojombo

once you get the response we need to add a new row in the page to show the following info: 
User avatar, company, email , number of followers and following, and name and number of public repos.

 

Notes: 

Try use useForm hook to build the form.
Use ES6 fetch method.
Convert returned response into JSON object.
Each time the user search for a new name, we need to append the result in a new row. If the user search for the same last entered name we don't send a new request, just scroll him to the last row in this case.
If one of the fields is null, just don't show it
